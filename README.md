# F21GP_CW2_Design
Our game for the coursework 2 of the Computer Games Programming course.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to make a prototype for a game with fun and innovating mechanisms.
Thus, we made the game `Galactic Shading Beat`, a game where colors change according to the beat of the current music.

## Installation

The game is only a small prototype, but if you want to download it, clone the repo and open it with Unity.
From there, you could try it easily.
